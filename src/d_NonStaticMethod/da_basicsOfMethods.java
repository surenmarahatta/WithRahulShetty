package d_NonStaticMethod;

public class da_basicsOfMethods {

//	Method also called Function, is a block of code that perform specific task.
//	we can define multiple Method within the class and call it as many times as we want to performed its task.
//	Method is defined outside the main method (either BEFORE or AFTER the Main Method) and can call within main method to execute task.
//	Method created in one class can be called in another class within same package or different package/project.
//		
//	Advantages of using Methods are	
//		we can create different Methods for different purpose
//		We can divide complex problems into multiple chunks
//		the method(code) can be reused multiple times
//		it will reduce code duplication
//		
//	Things to remember:
//		Return type:  
//			while defining the Method, the code inside the method will certainly utilize some datatypes
//			it will manupulate/recalculate those datatypes and give us the result/output as per our expectation
//			our output could be in the form of int, String, float, etc. 
//			Hence data type of the expected output is called Return type.
//			but sometime the piece of code do not recalculate/manupulate data and it simply print the content within " "
//			at this situation our return type is called void
//					
//		while defining the method, the set of code is always written within {  }
//		the method name is always followed by () eg: sum(), printName()
//		
//		we can insert any numbers of variables within () while defining methods which is called Parameter, 
// 	    for eg:  sum(int a, int b)  and while calling Method we have to pass value to the Parameter
//		for eg:  sum(7, 5) which is called Argument.
//			
//		
//	Types of Methods:
//		Classification 1st.
//		1. Pre Builds Methods:  Already define/created and we can simply call it when needed eg: println(), main()
//		2. User Define Methods: we define and call as and when needed
//			
//		Classification 2nd
//		1. Non Static Method:  need to create an object to call Non Static Method
//		2. Static Method:  can called directly and easily.  keyword Static need to mention before Methode name while declearing
//	
//		Classification 3rd
//			a. NO Return type and NO Parameter
//			b. Have Return type and NO parameter
//			c. HAVE Return type and YES Parameter
//						
//				parameter is the datatype-veriable inside the parenthesis of Method name (while defining the method).
//				when actual value is pass to the parameter (only while calling the function), the actual value is called Argument.
